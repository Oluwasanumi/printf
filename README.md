## printf

> write your own printf

## Welcome

> A rebuild of the standard printf function in C. printf returns the number of characters printed
> (excluding the null byte at the end of strings).
> We were not asked to handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length.

## ALX

> In ALX school we rarely use the c standard library, instead we are advised to build our our function and header as we learn.

## Description

> The function printf writes output to standard output. The function writes under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg) are converted for output.
